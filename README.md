# ME_POLYMORPHISM_JAVA

*A Project Repository for Polymorphism Byte in Java*


#### Debrief

-   Practical Scenarios

-   An add() method could add integers or decimals or strings or two objects of a class.
-   A display() method could call different overloaded methods depending on the parameter passed.
-   Operator overloading in languages

-   Summary of Polymorphism

-   Method overriding builds on top of inheritance.
-   Rules for overriding are

-   The functions should have the same name
-   Parameters should be same in number and type
-   The classes should be different for the overriding functions

-   Method overloading can be done within any class.
-   Rules for overloading are

-   Function names should be the same
-   Parameters should be different in numbers or in types
-   Functions should belong to the same class

-   **Why** is it useful? - presents the ability to perform different actions using the same method signature, keeping code cleaner.
-   **Where** to apply? - when child classes need to implement their own logic for methods provided by the parent class. Or when a class needs related methods to have the same method name with only a different set of parameters.
-   **How** to apply? - override/overload methods in the parent class from the child class. Language specific constructs apply.
-   What is the drawback if we donâ€™t use polymorphism? - maintaining code will be harder as some of the changes would require corresponding changes in all of the dependent/client code.
